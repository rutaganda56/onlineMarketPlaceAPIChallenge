# üöÄ Online Marketplace RESTful API
## üìù Introduction

This project is a comprehensive, feature-rich RESTful API for an online marketplace platform, enabling users to register as buyers or sellers, manage stores, list products, process orders, and submit reviews.

The API is built on Spring Boot, utilizes JWT for secure authentication, is fully containerized with Docker, and offers live documentation via Swagger UI. Robust validation and clear DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) are employed across all layers to ensure data integrity and separation of concerns.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Model & Entity Relationships

The system employs a relational structure to manage user interactions, inventory, and transactions:

| Store | 1:M with Product | Created and managed by a User (Seller). Represents a seller's storefront |
| Category | 1:M with Product | Classifies products into different categories |
| Product | M:1 with Store, 1:M with Review | The core inventory item. Managed by the Store/Seller |
| Order | M:1 with User (Buyer) | Represents a historical transaction, enabling the review eligibility check |
| Review | M:1 with User, M:1 with Product | User feedback on a product, validated against purchase history |
